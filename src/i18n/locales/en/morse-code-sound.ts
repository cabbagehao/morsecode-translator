      {
        question: "What does morse code sound like?",
        answer: "Morse code sounds like a series of short 'beeps' (dots) and longer 'beeps' (dashes) with specific timing patterns between them."
      },
      {
        question: "How fast should morse code be played?",
        answer: "Beginners should start at 5-13 WPM (words per minute), while proficient operators can handle 20+ WPM."
      },
      {
        question: "What frequency is best for morse code?",
        answer: "The standard frequency for morse code is around 600Hz, which provides good clarity and is easy on the ears."
